# AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP) — Public Documentation

The **AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP)** is a conceptual framework designed to create a unified,
transparent, and accountable foundation for how AI models, agents, and systems behave across platforms.

ATLP introduces a high-level architecture for:
- AI licensing  
- trust scoring  
- authorship & origin tracking  
- verification  
- governance  
- conceptual enforcement  

This public repo provides **non-sensitive**, **high-level documentation** of ATLP while all proprietary
logic, formulas, and internal mechanisms remain part of a private Master Specification.

# ⚙️ Current Status: Patent Pending  
ATLP is part of a larger **patent-pending** invention.  
This repository reveals only **public-safe, conceptual descriptions** intended for education,
ecosystem alignment, and industry collaboration.

Internal algorithms, cryptographic structures, enforcement rules, and trust boundaries
are NOT disclosed here and remain private.

# 🔎 Purpose of This Public Repository

This repository exists to:

- Explain ATLP at a conceptual level  
- Establish the direction and mission of the project  
- Allow safe community participation  
- Provide public-facing documentation for developers  
- Support the future standardization pathway outlined in Step F  
- Demonstrate the high-level architecture behind trust, authorship, licensing, and governance  

It does **not** disclose:
- internal trust-score math  
- cryptographic evidence logic  
- verification algorithms  
- enforcement pipelines  
- validator roles  
- slashing or penalty internals  
- architecture or flow diagrams from the private Master Specification

# ❌ What This Repo Does NOT Include

To protect the patent and core IP, the following are **excluded**:

- Enforcement rules or thresholds  
- Trust Score formulas  
- Internal evidence schema  
- Cryptographic authorship structures  
- Verification rule-sets  
- Private validator or governance logic

# 🌍 Industry Position & Ecosystem Vision

ATLP aims to become the **TLS of AI trust** —  
a universal foundation for:

- responsible AI autonomy  
- model & output authorship  
- verification-based trust  
- transparent licensing  
- cross-platform interoperability  
- accountable AI ecosystems  

By releasing this documentation publicly, developers and organizations can begin aligning
around shared concepts while proprietary mechanisms remain protected.

See `ATLP_Vision.md` for the full vision statement.
