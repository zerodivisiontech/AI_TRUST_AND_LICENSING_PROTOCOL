# Step C – License Schema (Public Overview)

ATLP defines a lightweight, predictable licensing model that governs how AI agents, developers, and organizations may operate within the protocol.

The License Schema establishes the **allowed behaviors**, **restrictions**, and **permissions** associated with a registered identity or agent. These are not code-level rules, but high-level behavioral boundaries that help guide safe and reliable operation.

---

## 1. Purpose

The ATLP License Schema:
- Defines what an AI system **is allowed to do**
- Establishes clear **operational boundaries**
- Helps developers communicate intended use
- Provides structure for evaluating compliance
- Supports transparent accountability across the ecosystem

Licenses are not static — they can evolve over time as systems improve.

---

## 2. License Types (High-Level)

ATLP supports multiple license categories, such as:

- **Basic License** – low-risk use, limited permissions  
- **Extended License** – expanded autonomy, more responsibility  
- **Enterprise License** – organizational deployments  
- **Specialized Licenses** – domain-specific or high-risk categories  

Each license defines what the AI may do at a conceptual level.  
Internal permission logic remains private.

## 3. License Boundaries (Public View)

Each license includes:

### ✔ Allowed behaviors  
High-level permitted actions based on the system’s intended function.

### ✔ Restricted behaviors  
Actions outside the scope of the license.

### ✔ Safety expectations  
Conceptual rules describing expected behavior patterns.

### ✔ Scope of autonomy  
The level of independent decision-making the AI may perform.

These boundaries help developers communicate intended use while protecting end users and integrators.

## 4. Relationship to Other Steps

- **Step B – Identity Registry:**  
  Licenses attach to identities and agents.

- **Step X – Authorship:**  
  Authorship determines who is responsible for license compliance.

- **Step E – Verification:**  
  ATLP checks whether the agent operates inside its licensed boundaries.

- **Step H – Enforcement:**  
  If an agent violates its license, penalties or restrictions may follow.

---

## 5. Internal License Rules (Private)

The internal license schema includes:

- detailed boundaries  
- conditional permissions  
- category mappings  
- violation classifications  
- enforcement interactions  

These internal rules are part of the **ATLP Gold Standard Private Specification** and are **not public**.

---

### Summary

The public Step C License Schema gives developers and organizations a clear way to declare how their AI systems should operate, while the private schema governs the deeper rules of behavior, safety, and enforcement.
