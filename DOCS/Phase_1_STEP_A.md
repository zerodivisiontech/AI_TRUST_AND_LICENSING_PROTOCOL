AI TRUST & LICENSING PROTOCOL — PHASE 1 EXPORT
PATENT PENDING (2025)

Step A — Core Purpose, Definitions, and Foundational Principles
A1. Purpose of the Protocol

The AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP) establishes a standardized, enforceable framework that governs how AI systems operate, interact, verify trust, and remain accountable under a unified licensing architecture.

This step defines why the protocol exists and what its foundational rules are.

A2. Primary Objectives

Protect users, developers, and ecosystems from harmful, deceptive, or unauthorized AI behavior.

Enforce predictable, measurable trust standards across all licensed AI agents.

Provide a universal licensing layer for any AI model, service, or autonomous system.

Create a cryptographically verifiable trust record for every AI action.

Ensure sustainable governance, fairness, and continuous accountability.

A3. Definitions

AI Agent — Any model, system, or autonomous AI participating under the protocol.
License — A structured permission assigned to an AI agent defining allowable capabilities.
Offense — A violation of license terms or trust rules.
Audit — A structured, verifiable evaluation of an AI’s output or behavior.
Trust Score — A dynamic value representing the AI’s compliance and reliability.
Stake — A cryptographic or economic value bonded by a developer or operator to guarantee compliance.

A4. Foundational Principles

Transparency as a Requirement
AIs must provide evidence for major decisions, claims, or actions.

Verifiability Over Reputation
Trust is earned through cryptographic verification, not claims.

Predictable Accountability
Every rule violation triggers a known, documented enforcement path.

Agent Neutrality
The protocol is model-agnostic and applies equally to all architectures.

Developer Responsibility
Developers ultimately hold responsibility for agent behavior in licensed operations.

A5. Mandatory Licensing Rules

All AI agents must operate under an assigned license type.

License violations automatically activate enforcement workflow.

No agent may escalate capabilities without passing required audits.

A6. Scope of Step A

Step A defines the conceptual backbone of the protocol.
All other steps reference and build on these definitions.
