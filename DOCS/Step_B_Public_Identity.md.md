# Step B — Licensing Model (Public Version)

## Overview
The ATLP Licensing Model defines the rights, responsibilities, and limitations
governing how an AI system is allowed to operate.

Traditional software licenses were never designed for:
- autonomous agents  
- self-directed actions  
- AI-generated content  
- trust scoring  
- verifiable behavior  

ATLP introduces a **new category of licensing**—built specifically for AI.

This public version describes the high-level concepts behind the licensing model
without exposing internal or patent-sensitive enforcement logic.

## Why Traditional Licensing Fails for AI

AI systems create far more than software outputs.  
They generate:

- text  
- images  
- code  
- decisions  
- actions  
- autonomous processes  

And they do these things:
- unpredictably  
- dynamically  
- sometimes independently  

Traditional licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache) were never intended to regulate:
- an AI acting on behalf of a user  
- an autonomous agent making decisions  
- trust-based permissions  
- behavioral constraints  
- revocable rights  

ATLP licenses are designed *specifically* for these realities.

## Key Goals of the ATLP Licensing Model

### 🔹 1. **Define clear AI permissions**
Models and agents must know:
- what they can do  
- what they cannot do  
- what requires higher trust  

### 🔹 2. **Protect developers and creators**
Licensing establishes:
- authorship  
- ownership  
- permitted use  
- acceptable deployment  

### 🔹 3. **Enable safe autonomy**
Advanced agents can operate independently *only if* they meet trust requirements.

### 🔹 4. **Provide predictable consequences**
Violations must result in:
- predictable outcomes  
- transparent governance decisions  
- trust-related adjustments  

### 🔹 5. **Support interoperability**
Licenses must apply across:
- platforms  
- frameworks  
- agents  
- user environments

## High-Level License Types

(This is a conceptual overview; full rule logic is private.)

### 🔸 **1. Standard License**
For basic AI systems performing predictable tasks.
- Limited autonomy  
- Basic trust requirements  
- Regular verification checks  

### 🔸 **2. Enhanced License**
For more capable agents with situational decision-making.
- Greater autonomy  
- Additional responsibilities  
- Higher trust threshold  

### 🔸 **3. Restricted License**
For sensitive or safety-critical systems.
- Narrow permissions  
- Extensive oversight  
- Stricter verification boundaries  

### 🔸 **4. Observational / Read-Only License**
AI can analyze but cannot act or modify external data.

### 🔸 **5. Creative Output License (for generative AI)**
Allows controlled content creation while preserving:
- authorship  
- attribution  
- rights for developers

## How Licensing Connects to the Rest of ATLP

Licensing is the **anchor** for the entire ATLP ecosystem.

- **Verification (Step C)** checks whether behavior matches license rules  
- **Trust Score (Step E)** changes based on licensed behavior  
- **Governance (Step G)** decides licensing updates  
- **Enforcement (Step H)** acts when licenses are violated  
- **Authorship (Step X)** defines who is responsible for outputs  

Licensing defines the “rules of the game.”

## Public vs Internal View

This public version describes:
- What ATLP licenses are  
- Why AI needs them  
- What types exist  
- How licensing fits into ATLP’s structure  

The private master specification includes:
- detailed rule logic  
- violation boundaries  
- trust-based permission formulas  
- revocation algorithms  
- cross-platform enforcement logic  

These remain proprietary and patent-protected.
