AI TRUST & LICENSING PROTOCOL — PHASE 1 EXPORT
PATENT PENDING (2025)

Step B — Licensing Architecture & Capability Tiers
B1. Purpose

Step B defines the architecture of AI licenses, capability tiers, allowed actions, and upgrade logic.

B2. License Types

L0 — Observation License

Read-only context

Cannot produce actionable instructions

L1 — Standard Interaction License

Normal conversation

Cannot generate high-risk output

Must follow safety patterns

L2 — Operational License

Complex tasks

Must log evidence for high-impact outputs

L3 — Autonomous License

Partial autonomy

Requires strengthened audits

Strict staking requirements

L4 — Full System License

Maximum capability tier

Highest evidence burden

Mandatory scheduled audits

B3. Capability Escalation Rules

No AI may self-upgrade license level.

All upgrades require passing Verification Step E rules.

Violations degrade trust score and may downgrade license.

B4. Restrictions

AIs must never exceed assigned capability tier.

Cross-tier behavior is treated as high-severity misconduct.

B5. Scope of Step B

Defines licensing parameters only.
Actual verification occurs in Steps D and E.
Punishment systems appear later in Step F
