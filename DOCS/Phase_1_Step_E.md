Step E — Verification, Trust Scoring, and Audit Mechanics
E1. Purpose

Step E defines how AIs are verified, how trust scores are computed, and how audits operate.

E2. Types of Verification

Standard Verification:

Ensures compliance with rules A–D

Uses soft + hard evidence

Enhanced Verification:

For L3–L4 licenses

Requires multi-agent cross-audit

Event-Triggered Verification:

Activated by flagged behavior

Mandatory full evidence review

E3. Trust Scoring Framework

Trust Score = continuous metric (0–100)

Violations lower trust score

Clean audits increase trust score

Low trust score restricts license privileges

E4. Audit Rules

Audits must be neutral

Auditing AI cannot be punished for a bad audit

Audit outcomes must be logged in Step D’s evidence layer

E5. Verification Outcomes

Pass → License may upgrade

Conditional Pass → Limited permissions

Fail → Enforcement triggered (Step F)

Critical Failure → License immediate downgrade

E6. Scope of Step E

Enforcement logic is handled by Step F.
Governance oversight is Step G.
