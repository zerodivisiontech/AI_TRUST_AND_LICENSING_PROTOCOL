# ATLP – Compliance Overview (Public Version)

The ATLP Compliance Overview provides a **high-level summary** of how the protocol promotes safe, responsible, and consistent use of licensed AI systems. This document intentionally avoids all internal enforcement logic, trust rules, or violation structures, which remain part of the **private ATLP Gold Standard Specification**.

This overview helps developers, organizations, and future contributors understand the goals and expectations of compliance within ATLP.

## 1. Purpose of Compliance in ATLP

ATLP’s compliance model ensures:

- AI systems operate within their declared licensing boundaries  
- developers and organizations follow safe deployment practices  
- key decisions and actions are attributable to legitimate identities  
- misuse, unsafe behavior, and license violations can be detected  
- the broader ecosystem maintains trust and predictability  

Compliance is not about punishment — it is about **alignment**, **clarity**, and **responsibility**.

## 2. What Compliance Covers (High-Level)

### ✔ Licensing
Ensuring AI models and agents operate according to the permissions defined in their ATLP license.

### ✔ Identity
Making sure responsible parties can be clearly identified (without revealing internal identity mechanisms).

### ✔ Authorship
Ensuring actions are attributable to the correct developer or authorized entity (Step X overview only).

### ✔ Safe Operation
Reinforcing that AI actions should be:
- safe  
- predictable  
- aligned with user intent  
- consistent with public ATLP expectations  

### ✔ Transparency
Developers and organizations are expected to be open about:
- the purpose of their AI system  
- intended behavior  
- known limitations  
- update and versioning practices

## 3. What ATLP Compliance Does *Not* Include (Public)

ATLP’s compliance framework does **not** enforce:

- content moderation  
- moral or political value systems  
- specific output preferences  
- mandatory filtering or censorship  
- domain-specific rules outside of licensing boundaries  

ATLP is a **foundational trust and accountability protocol**, not a content or ethics governance system.

---

## 4. Shared Responsibility Model

ATLP uses a shared model of compliance:

### **Developers**
- define clear intended use  
- implement safe updates  
- maintain authorship and licensing claims  
- follow best practices during deployment  

### **Organizations**
- ensure safe integration  
- handle identity and delegation securely  
- monitor high-risk or autonomous systems  

### **Ecosystem**
- provides frameworks for identity, authorship, and licensing  
- offers public documentation and guidelines  
- maintains transparent governance and proposal pathways  

---

## 5. Non-Public Compliance Components (Private)

The following compliance mechanisms are part of the **private Gold Standard**, and are not exposed publicly:

- violation categories  
- penalty and recovery logic  
- trust scoring and trust mapping  
- enforcement rules  
- identity resolution flows  
- authorship key requirements  
- verification engine internals  
- redemption mechanics  
- evidence chain logic  
- governance escalation paths  

These are restricted to maintain security, fairness, and resistance to manipulation.

---

## 6. Future Compliance Expansion (Event-Triggered)

As ATLP matures and adoption grows, future event triggers may allow expansion of the public-facing compliance documentation to include:

- domain-specific compliance guidelines  
- recommended industry practices  
- ATLP alignment checklists  
- public compliance FAQs  
- expansion to enterprise and regulatory audiences  

These expansions will occur only when the ecosystem, governance, and contributor base reach defined milestones.

---

## Summary

ATLP’s compliance model is designed to support:

- safe AI deployment  
- responsible developer behavior  
- clear ownership and authorship  
- transparent, ecosystem-wide expectations  

While the deeper mechanics of compliance are private, this overview helps developers understand the role compliance plays in ATLP’s mission to build a trustworthy, permission-based AI ecosystem.
